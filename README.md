# [Abandoned] grollrs 
A PoC of a trinity client written with rust.
This Project has been abandoned due to severe errors in the architecture. 
In addition I needed to investigate certain aspects of Netty and therefore wrote a re-implementation in java [grollj](https://github.com/grollrs/grollj). 
Since I have not touched the code for months, it most likely won't compile now.
